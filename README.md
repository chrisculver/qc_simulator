# Readme

A minimal quantum circuit simulator written in rust.  This was done as a "learning rust" project, so 
there are no guarauntees about efficiency (it is in fact inefficient) or feature completeness.  
If you are looking for a more complete quantum computing rust package check out 
[RustQIP](https://github.com/Renmusxd/RustQIP).  

To see it in action download the repository and type `cargo run`, the code in `main.rs` should 
be self explanatory for users familiar with quantum computing, as it mimics
most quantum computing libraries.  There are also a set of unit
tests included, to run them use `cargo test`.
